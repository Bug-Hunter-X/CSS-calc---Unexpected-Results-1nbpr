The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you don't carefully consider operator precedence and unit consistency. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a nested element might not work as expected if the parent element's dimensions aren't explicitly set or are themselves calculated.
